 <h3>   1. Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl (2020)    </h3>
<p>   
    ‚≠ê Rating: 4/5<br>
    üé¨ Review:<br>
    This inspiring biopic tells the story of Gunjan Saxena, 
    one of India‚Äôs first female Air Force pilots in combat. 
    Janhvi Kapoor delivers a sincere performance, supported 
    by Pankaj Tripathi‚Äôs heartwarming portrayal of a supportive father.
    The film effectively showcases the struggles of a woman in a male-dominated
    profession, with emotional depth and strong storytelling. 
    While some creative liberties were taken, it remains a motivational watch.

<h3>    2. Fighter (2024)   </h3>
<p>
    ‚≠ê Rating: 3.5/5<br>
    üé¨ Review:<br>
    This action-packed aerial thriller, 
    starring Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone, 
    is a high-octane Bollywood take on the Indian Air Force. 
    The film impresses with its stunning visuals, gripping aerial 
    combat sequences, and patriotic fervor. However, the storyline 
    follows a predictable path with moments of melodrama. Still, 
    the performances and VFX make it an entertaining watch for action lovers.

<h3>    3. Anand (1971) </h3>
<p> 
    ‚≠ê Rating: 5/5<br>
    üé¨ Review:<br>
    An eternal classic, Anand is an emotional rollercoaster that beautifully 
    blends joy and sorrow. Rajesh Khanna‚Äôs portrayal of a terminally ill but 
    ever-optimistic Anand is iconic, while Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs restrained 
    performance adds depth. The dialogues, music, and life-affirming message 
    make it one of Bollywood‚Äôs finest films. No matter how many times you 
    watch it, it leaves an emotional impact.
