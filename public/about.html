<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi, I’m Deepa!</h2>
<h3>Aspiring Web Developer | Math Enthusiast | Problem Solver</h3>
<p>
  I’m a passionate learner diving into the world of web development. 
  With a strong background in teaching mathematics and environmental studies,
   I’ve always loved problem-solving—now, I’m bringing that same curiosity 
   into coding!
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I’m mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, working towards becoming
   a full-stack web developer in the next three months. 
</p>

<p>
   My goal? <br>
   To create interactive, user-friendly websites and eventually 
   build innovative web applications.
</p> 

<p>
  When I’m not coding, you’ll find me drawing, dancing, or exploring 
  new ideas. I believe in learning by doing, and my journey with DeeCode 
  is just beginning. Stay tuned as I turn this website into something amazing!
